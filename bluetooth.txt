It's possible the device will disconnect and you'll  
have to:

$ bluetoothctl
agent on 
scan on 
trust A0:E9:DB:03:56:E0 
pair A0:E9:DB:03:56:E0
connect A0:E9:DB:03:56:E0

If it doesn't work, do: 
remove A0:E9:DB:03:56:E0
pair A0:E9:DB:03:56:E0
connect A0:E9:DB:03:56:E0

To set up the Bluetooth speakers as default in pavucontrol:

$ pavucontrol

There's a green checkbox that will make future playback default 
to the Bluetooth speakers, to the right of the lock icon. It says
"set as fallback".

The MAC address of the speaker will not change: A0:E9:DB:03:56:E0
